# Face and Body Detection with OpenCV

## Description
This project uses OpenCV (`cv2`) to capture video from a webcam and perform face and body detection using pre-trained Haar cascades. When a face or body is detected, the program starts recording a video. The recording stops automatically after a few seconds of no detection. This guide will walk you through each step of the process.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` library)
- A webcam connected to your computer

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
