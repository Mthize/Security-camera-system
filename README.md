# Face and Body Detection with OpenCV

## Description
This project uses OpenCV (`cv2`) to capture video from a webcam and detect faces and bodies using pre-trained Haar cascades. When a face or body is detected, the program automatically starts recording a video, and the recording stops a few seconds after detection ends. This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown of the code.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` library)
- A webcam

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
